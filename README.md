## üßóüèª My Learning Achievements & Project Highlights: 
- [Udacity SQL Nanodegree](https://graduation.udacity.com/confirm/GAFFAGZP)
  - Project-1: Created a report for the executive team on the topic of global & country-level deforestation by writing complex and advanced SQL queries. 
  - Project-2: Investigated a poorly designed database and re-designed a new, normalised and performant database and migrated over data from the previous database.  
- [Udacity Data Visualisation Nanodegree](https://graduation.udacity.com/confirm/AD44QHWJ)
  - Project-1: Designed a Tableau dashboard which shows YoY performance in customer segmentation with different KPIs (Revenue, Profit, Profit ratio, etc).
  - Project-2: Created an animated data story and added an audio track for it to become a narrated Flourish story. 
- [Udacity NLP Nanodegree](https://graduation.udacity.com/confirm/YSHK6MDV)
  - Project-1: Built a spam email classifier using Naive Bayes algorithm that achieves Accuracy score: 0.988, Precision score: 0.972, Recall score: 0.941.
  - Project-2: Built a hidden Markov model for part of speech tagging with a universal tagset that achieves a test accuracy of 95.95%. 
  - Project-3: Built a deep neural network end-to-end machine translation pipeline that accepts English text as input and return the French translation. 
  - Project-4: Built a deep neural network end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline that accepts raw audio as input and returns a predicted transcription of the spoken language. 
- [Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree](https://graduation.udacity.com/confirm/ZHLH4AAE)
  - Project-1: Created a machine learning pipeline that categorises real messages sent during disaster events into 36 categories that achieves an overall accuracy ~90%. 
  - Project-2: Collected and analysed a real user-article interaction dataset from IBM Watson Studio Platform and improves the user-article recommendation rate to ~95% with Final Matrix Factorization algorithm. 
- [Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree](https://graduation.udacity.com/confirm/PRYYR69M)
  - Project-1: Trained and deployed an XGBoost model on AWS SageMaker for IMDB movie review sentiment classification which meets ~85% accuracy.
  - Project-2: Built a plagiarism detector that examines a text file and performs binary classification by comparing containment and longest common subsequence with an accuracy of 96%. 
  - Project-3: Deployed a machine learning web app on Streamlit to predict the stock market sentiment with over ~2000 daily news headlines and reached a ~84% accuracy (fine-tuned random forest classifier) & 81% (baseline logistic regression model). 
- [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://graduation.udacity.com/confirm/XKVJEVVR)
  - Project-1: Built a simple neural network and used it to predict daily bike rental ridership on a timeseries dataset.
  - Project-2: Created a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning VGG16) with an accuracy of 84%. 
  - Project-3: Built a neural network (RNN & LSTM) that will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in the training data.
  - Project-4: Defined and trained a DCGAN on a dataset of faces to get a generator network and generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible.
